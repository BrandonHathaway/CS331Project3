Contributions:
		Sadly, because of the fact that this project is comprised of three parts: halving the code was a harder concept. Since the C10Q7 was a copy paste job, it worked out well in terms of work specifically for this project.
		Just like the last project, all work is presented on GitHub, and javadocs are on the gh-pages branch. The javadocs is excluded from the .zip file, to avoid unecessary bloat.

	Mark Eikel:
			Implemented the entirety of Question 6 from Chapter 7.
			This includes all classes within, Vehicle, Person, Truck, and the C7_Question6 test class. We chose to use Brandon's C10Q7 because of his better implementation previously.
	Brandon Hathaway:
			C7Q7 - C10Q7
