/** Give the definition of two classes, Patient and Billing, whose objects are records for a clinic. Patient will be
 *  derived from the class Person given in Programming Project 7.6. A Patient record has the patient's name (inherited
 *  from the class Person) and primary physician of type octor defined in Programming Project 7.5. A Billing object will
 *  contain a Patient object, a Doctor object, and an amount due of type double. Be sure your classes have a reasonable
 *  complement of constructors, accesor, and mutator methods, and suitably defined euals and toString methods. First
 *  write a driver program to test all your methods, then write a test program that creates at least two patients, at
 *  least two doctors and at least two Billing records, and then prints out the total income from the Billing records.
